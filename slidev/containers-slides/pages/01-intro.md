# Lesson 1: Fundamentals of Containerization

---

## What is Containerization?

- TLDR; Its like a VM but lightweight. It is sort of like a "different computer" but not as much as a VM.
- VM's run an OS with a hypervisor
- Containers use process isolation
- VM -> OS in an OS
- Container -> uses your existing OS more, only
